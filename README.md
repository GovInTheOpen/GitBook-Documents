## Similar Organizations

* [Harvard Civic Analytics Network](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/civic-analytics-network-members-881) - Inspiration for OGC.  CAN has a much broader focus and just a few US cities are involved.  OGC should have more cities, states, countries and is focused on code projects.
