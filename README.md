## Similar Organizations

* [Harvard Civic Analytics Network](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/civic-analytics-network-members-881) - Inspiration for OGC.  Many OGC collaborators come from CAN cities.  CAN has a much broader focus and just a few US cities are involved.  OGC should have more cities, states, countries and is focused on code projects.
* [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) - Helped create the OGC by pushing for tech talent and skills inside of government with brigades and open source.  Many OGC participants came from CfA.  Big difference is that OGC may work on sensitive data or internal systems integrations that can't be made public, though CfA can still be part of the efforts.
