## Projects in Review

List of projects that are being reviewed to see if they can be included in OGC.

### - IFTTT for Cities

Automation services for citizens based off existing city APIs and open data.

**Code**: [github.com/LouisvilleMetro/IFTTT-Smart-Louisville](https://github.com/LouisvilleMetro/IFTTT-Smart-Louisville)

* _Collaborating Govs _\([Data Access Project](https://ifttt.com/blog/2017/06/introducing-the-data-access-project)\): Louisville, Tampa, Texas, Edmonton
* _Promoter_: IFTTT

### - SQUID - Road Quality through Camera Images

An open source data pipeline and analytics framework for assessing street quality. This approach utilizes the open source Open Street Cam to collect GPS, accelerometer and imagery data to be able to literally see the Ground Truth.

**Project Submission Page: **[OGC Discussion](https://github.com/GovInTheOpen/Project-Portfolio/issues/2)

**Code**: [github.com/streets-data-collaborative](https://github.com/streets-data-collaborative)

* _Collaborating Govs_: NYC
* _Promoter_: ARGO Labs

### - Zotero Metadata Translator

**Code**: [zotero.org/support/dev/translators](https://www.zotero.org/support/dev/translators)

## Similar Organizations

* [Harvard Civic Analytics Network](http://datasmart.ash.harvard.edu/news/article/civic-analytics-network-members-881) - Inspiration for OGC.  Many OGC collaborators come from CAN cities.  CAN has a much broader focus and just a few US cities are involved.  OGC should have more cities, states, countries and is focused on code projects.
* [Code for America](https://www.codeforamerica.org/) - Helped create the OGC by pushing for tech talent and skills inside of government with brigades and open source.  Many OGC participants came from CfA.  Big difference is that OGC may work on sensitive data or internal systems integrations that can't be made public, though CfA can still be part of the efforts.
* [Code.gov](https://code.gov/#/) - At the federal level, but it leverages the power of code sharing and collaboration to help the US Government cut down on duplicative software development and save millions of taxpayer dollars for the American people.
